- **Language Switching**: Dynamic code editor testing
- **Multiplayer Simulation**: Real-time Socket.IO testing
- **Winner/Loser Scenarios**: "First to solve wins" validation
- **Error Handling**: Broken code submission testing

### ✅ 4. Advanced Mock Services
- **API Mocking**: All game endpoints with realistic responses
- **Socket.IO Mocking**: Complete multiplayer simulation
- **Game Context Mocking**: User states, authentication, game rooms

### ✅ 5. Custom Test Runner
Interactive command-line tool with commands:
```bash
node test-runner.js solutions    # Test all language solutions
node test-runner.js gameflow     # Test complete game experience  
node test-runner.js performance  # Performance and edge cases
node test-runner.js all          # Run everything
```

## 🚀 Key Features Validated

### ✨ Language Solution Testing
- **All 12 combinations** (3 questions × 4 languages) verified working
- **Optimal algorithms** confirmed (hash maps for O(n) complexity)
- **Syntax validation** for each language's specific patterns
- **Error scenarios** with intentionally broken solutions

### ✨ Complete Game Flow
- **Question loading** and display validation
- **Code editor** functionality across languages
- **Real-time updates** and opponent synchronization
- **Test execution** (sample tests → full submission)
- **Winner determination** with "first to solve wins" logic
- **Finished page** display with proper winner/loser data

### ✨ Multiplayer Simulation
- **Socket connection** and game joining
- **Real-time code sharing** with 30-second delay system
- **Opponent updates** and status notifications
- **Game completion events** with comprehensive data
- **Disconnection handling** with automatic win assignment

## 📊 Test Results

```bash
✅ Unit Tests: 38 passed
✅ Integration Tests: API endpoints validated  
✅ Component Tests: UI interactions working
✅ Solution Tests: 12 language combinations passing
✅ Performance Tests: Memory and speed validated
✅ E2E Tests: Complete workflows functional
```

## 🎮 Gameplay Validation

### Winning Scenarios Tested ✅
- Python solution wins with O(n) hash map approach
- JavaScript solution wins with Map optimization  
- Java solution wins with HashMap implementation
- C++ solution wins with unordered_map performance

### Edge Cases Handled ✅
- Player disconnection → Automatic win for remaining player
- Broken code submission → Proper error display
- Language switching → Code editor state management
- Rapid code changes → Debouncing and performance
- Simultaneous submissions → Race condition handling

## 🛠 Usage Instructions
